This is the build diary of my GBS Zero kit car, a 2 seat Lotus 7 style sports car that uses a Mazda MX-5 as a parts donor. I started the project in 2013 and eventually finished it in 2016. I am doing this ‘blog’ to add another aspect to the project which will hopefully help me keep focused and provide a useful reference for future projects and anyone interested in kit cars. 

It's been an engaging and emensly satisfying project and I would encourage anyine thinking of building a car to just et on and do it.

Good luck!
