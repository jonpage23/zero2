Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

## This is the first headder 2

Lightbox has been enabled for images. To create the link that'll launch the lightbox, add <code>data-lightbox</code> and <code>data-title</code> attributes to an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag around your <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. The result is:

<a href="//bencentra.com/assets/images/falcon9_large.jpg" data-lightbox="falcon9-large" data-title="Check out the Falcon 9 from SpaceX">
  <img src="//bencentra.com/assets/images/falcon9_small.jpg" title="Check out the Falcon 9 from SpaceX">
</a>
