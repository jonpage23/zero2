And again I leave this Blog neglected for too long.

A lot has happened which I will commit to words in the next few weeks, but right now I can report that a major milestone has been reached - I have successfully started the engine!

It doesn't sound like much, and really it should be a formality, but considering this engine hasn't run for almost 2 years, it has a whole new wiring loom, new ECU, new fuel system and throttles, it's not a bad achievement.

More updates to follow as I have got a bit further with the build.
