Again, a long time since my last post. I hit a bit of a slow spot over the holiday period, weather, travel, work, travel for work, and generally not liking the cold that much, conspired against the project. However, I am back on it and can report on brake lines, calipers, fuel lines, and fuel pumps... I think.

The last of the brake lines are now routed and the ends flared, that is except the front right line to the caliper as the spare female unions have disappeared somewhere in the depths of my garage. I've had to move the line slightly at rear of the tunnel now I have the handbrake assembly. The cable from the handbrake lever brushed against the brake line when pulled on. The new route is slightly lower and actually helps with the routing of the fuel lines.

Brake calipers have now been cleaned up and refurbished. Help from my brother again here and I admit to having been a bit worried about tackling this job myself. The most time and care needed to be taken when cleaning and rubbing down the inside of the cylinders around the slots for the seals. The seals themselves are fiddly to get in and one wrong move could put a dent of crack in them rendering them useless. The rear calipers incorporate an over complicated handbrake mechanism that is supposed to self-adjust somehow. We couldn't work out how it was supposed to work, only that the whole mechanism was ceased on one side.

I am pleased to report that all seals, pistons, and dust covers are now safely installed, and looking very professional if I may say so.

Fuel lines now. I am advised that these can effectively be 'hung' from the brake lines as long as they are secured near the p-clips. I got a couple of sheets of aluminium for odd panels and brackets that might need to be made up and cut a mounting plate for the filter and low pressure pump out of this. These mount neatly behind the differential with a piece of fuel hose connecting them. I need to finalize the routing for the fuel lines as the come out of the tunnel and run to the pump and tank, for that I need to fit the hand brake assembly.

At the front I have mounted the swirl pot and high pressure fuel pump in front of the driver side foot well. Quite a neat job, but the pump needs a bit more foam padding around the bracket to make it tight.

So, a fair bit of progress it seems. I am painfully short of space in my garage so I intend to fit the engine and transmission next, which should free up some space to fit the side panels and suspension. It might even look like a car soon..!
