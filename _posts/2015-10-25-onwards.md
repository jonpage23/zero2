And again, I neglect the Blog. My apologies. And I must also report that a significant amount has happened in the time since the previous post in March, the most significant of which is that I have moved house and spent most of the summer renovating it. This has left the car a little neglected, but before I moved, I had to get the car in to a state where but I could move it as well.

Previously I had succeeded in getting the engine started. It runs well, albeit a bit rich, which is a great relief. Due to limited space in the garage I had built all the parts of the car such as suspension, brakes, nose etc. separately, fitted them, then removed everything ready for a final assembly at the point I could move the car.

I realise this this is going to miss out a fair amount of actual work which I have not had time to commit to words, but at end of May I finally got to the point of needing to move the car from the garage under the flat to my new place. As per the plan, the parts were duly fetched from all corners of the flat and one by one bolted to the chassis.!

I wanted to fit the seats so I could drive it out of the garage which meant fitting the carpets as I didn’t want to remove the seats again. I had already cut the carpet for the rear panel and side of the tunnel, as well as covering the panels for the top of the tunnel so these when in fairly easily.

I then needed to get it down on to its wheels. Less said about this the better really, but I used to engine hoist attached to the centre of the chassis to lift it off the trestles and on to the ground. It worked, but I hope I don’t have to do it again…

Obviously I can’t drive the car on the road yet so I booked a tow truck to put it on. The time had come to drive it for the first time. Just a short journey out of the garage, on to the waiting truck, and off again at the house.

So, there’s no proper garage at the new place yet so I’ve invested in an “Instant Garage” to house the car for the time being.

First impressions: Brilliant! This is going to be a lot of fun to drive. I’ve got a load of trim to finish and various things to complete for the IVA but realistically this is not going to happen this year. I shall look forward to getting it on the road in the Spring.
