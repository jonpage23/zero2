Greetings,<br/><br/>
This is planned to be an on-line diary of my latest project - the building of a 2 seat Lotus 7 style kit sports car.

After much deliberation I have decided to go for the "Zero" made by Great British Sports Cars near Newark, England. It has an exciting, more aggressive, serious fun look and feel about it than other cars I considered  It's also very good value and I was impressed with the factory setup when I visited. I'm building the new Mazda donor based kit and have recently acquired a very tidy 1996 1.8l MX-5 for the job.

Please remember any views expressed are my own, and whilst Iâ€™ll make every effort to ensure the contents of every post is factually accurate I take no responsibility for loss or damage to anyone or anything acting on anything written here.

Further posts as I make progress, or lack of. Comments and questions welcome.

Jon.
