Well, I could real off a list of excuses as to why I haven't updated the blog recently but they are, as I say, excuses. Here's a quick update anyway:

The car is basically finished and I am waiting to take it in for it's IVA test in a few days time. Here's a few pictures of the (almost) completed car both outside my old flat and in front of the Instant Garage on my patio.

I had attached the wheels and enough running gear to be able to move the car from the garage under my old flat to my new house. Here it was waiting for the transporter to arrive.

I wanted to fit the seats so I could drive it out of the garage which meant fitting the carpets as I didnâ€™t want to remove the seats again. I had already cut the carpet for the rear panel and side of the tunnel, as well as covering the panels for the top of the tunnel so these when in fairly easily.

After a few very hot days in the instant garage, the glue on the carpets on melted. I had to take the seats out to put it all back again.

I'm really pleased with the dashboard. The modern gauges hint at the newer engine and electronics than the classic sports car styling suggests.

I will endeavour to post a few more photos after the IVA test if I haven't been battered too much.
